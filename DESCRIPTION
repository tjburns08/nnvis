Title: Visualize the quality of a low-dimensional embedding for mass 
    cytometry datasets, and try popular lowd embedding methods.

Description: This package examines the quality of a low-dimensional embedding
    by comparing the membership of each cell's k-nearest neighbors (KNN) in 
    original high dimensional marker space with this cell's KNN in the 
    low-dimensional space. Comparisons can be visualized with average fidelity
    plots for different values of K, or the t-SNE maps themselves can be 
    colored by their own fidelity. The package also provides wrappers for 
    popular low dimensional embeddings.
